Jawr Generators
---------------

In some cases it is convenient to generate scripts, CSS or images
dynamically. For instance, Jawr will create certain scripts to, say,
copy i18n messages from a ResourceBundle over to a special script. You
may need to retrieve some data from a database and create parameters
that scripts will need, or simply grab parameters from a configuration
file and pass them over to the scripting context. For any case where you
may need to generate content you can implement a Resource Generator and
register it in Jawr to suit your needs. Â 

Note that a Resource Generator is **not** a *script servlet*: it will be
only invoked once during application startup to build the bundles in
Production mode. The result of this invocation will be added to
whichever bundle you decide and reused until the next redeployment. The
point is to be able to generate some script dynamically but still to be
able to minify it and add it to your bundles. A perfect example is the
DWR generator: all DWR script interfaces are created from java classes
once during startup but they can be minified and bundled together. In
debug mode, it will be called as any resource if needed.

### Using a generator

Generators are mapped to bundles using a GeneratorResolver. This
resolver is used to determine if a resource is a generated resource or
not. Prior to the 3.5 version, users were only able to use a prefix to
map resources to a generator. Since the 3.5 version, users can define
their own resolver. There are 2 built-in types of resolver :

-   net.jawr.web.resource.bundle.generator.resolver.PrefixedPathResolver
    : For prefix path resolver
-   net.jawr.web.resource.bundle.generator.resolver.SuffixedPathResolver
    : For suffix path resolver

Example of prefixed path generator :

	prefix:path(params)[params]


The prefix is a key you will specify when implementing the Generator,
and the path is a string which will have different meaning depending on
your generator's functionality. Also, you have params in parentheses and
in brackets (both of which are optional), that further help in
parameterizing the mappings. A simple mapping example, with no params,
is as follows:

	jawr.js.bundle.one.mappings=jar:net/jawr/cpscript.js


In this case we are using the already existing classpath script
generator, which reads a script from the classpath, as opposed to
reading it from the web application dir structure. So the path in this
case is the classpath where the script will be found. The prefix is
'jar', which lets Jawr know that this path must be resolved using the
classpath generator.

This is an example in which the mapping uses two different parameters:


	jawr.js.bundle.one.mappings=messages:com.myapp.messages(mynamespace)[javascript.messages]


Note that if you use the parameters, the order must always be
parentheses first, brackets last. If you need only one parameter, you
can omit the brackets param.

It is possible to escape the parentheses and the brackets if these
characters are used in your resource path using the escape character
'\\'. Here isan example :

	jawr.js.bundle.one.mappings=webjars:/datatables-plugins/1.10.9/api/sum\(\).js

### Jawr generators

Jawr comes with several generators, each accomplishing a special kind of
task. The currently provided generators are:

### All-around generators


[**i18n messages script generator**]()
--------------------------------------

-   **Prefix**: message

This generator generates javascript code with locale specific variants
which are loaded depending on the user's specific language. Full
documentation is [here](./messages_gen.html).


[**DWR scripts generator**]()
-----------------------------

-   **Prefix**: dwr

This generator allows you to bundle and compress together DWR generated
interfaces, plus all the utility scripts required by them. Full
documentation is [here](../integration/dwr.html).

[**Commons Validator generator**]()
-----------------------------------

-   **Prefix**: acv

This one will let you generate compressed and cacheable versions of the
validation scripts generated in Struts by the Apache Commons Validator
taglib. Full docs [here](../integration/validator.html).


[**classpath resource generator**]()
------------------------------------

-   **Prefix**: jar

It allows you to include resources present within jar files or simply
located anywhere in the application classpath. You will need to use
different prefixes if you are generating js or css files. To add
javascript resources from the classpath you use **jar:** as the prefix,
followed by the path to the resource using / as separator:

	jawr.js.bundle.foo.id=/bundles/fooBundle.js
	# Map to a script in the com.mycompany.myapp package and to another from the WAR 
	jawr.js.bundle.foo.mappings=jar:/com/mycompany/myapp/foo.js, /js/bar.js
            
Note the leading slash in the mapping, which is also required. You can
of course combine this kind of mappings with regular ones, so you can
bundle together resources from the WAR and from the classpath.

If you need to load CSS files from the classpath, you would use the
exact same syntax **jar:**.

	jawr.css.bundle.styles.mappings=jar:/com/mycompany/myapp/stylesheet.css, /css/bar.css   

CSS files loaded from the classpath may refer to images which will
normally be available from the classpath as well. Since version 2.8 Jawr
can serve such image files by defining an extra instance of the servlet
with its init param **type** set to **img**. You can find details on how
to set it up at the [servlet configuration page.](./servlet.html)

Unlike the normal mapping, this way of referring to resources does not
yet allow wildcards (i.e.: *jar:/com/mycompany/myapp/\*\** would not
work).

[**Webjars generator**]()
-------------------------

-   **Prefix**: webjars

This generator allows you to include resources which are stored in a
webjars files. WebJars are client-side web libraries (e.g. jQuery &
Bootstrap) packaged into JAR files. You will have to include your
webjars as dependencies of your project and then reference them as
follow :

	jawr.js.bundle.foo.mappings=webjars:/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.js, /js/foo.js        

To reference webjars resources, you can now use short reference instead
of full one. For example, you can now use :
**webjars:/css/bootstrap.css*/* instead of
**webjars:/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.css** To avoid resource
reference collision if there multiple resource with the same name in
different webjars, you can specify the webjars in parameter between
bracket like below :

	jawr.css.bundle.foo.mappings=webjars:/css/bootstrap.css[bootstrap]      

-   Important note\* : For CSS resources, it is important to note that
    you should pay attention to the resource path used in your mapping,
    because this may lead to issues in binary resources (image,
    fonts, ...) references in the generated resource. We strongly advise
    you to use the resource path after the version number. For example :
    The bootstrap CSS resource is under
    \*/META-INF/resources/webjars/bootstrap/*version*/css/bootstrap.css\*
    in the webjars file. To reference this resource you should use the
    path after the version number like :

	jawr.css.bundle.foo.mappings=webjars:/css/bootstrap.css[bootstrap]      

-   To be able to use the short reference for webjars resource, you need
    to add webjars-locator-core library in you classpath. For maven
    user, you'll need to define a dependency in your pom.xml :


                    <dependency>
                                <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
                                <artifactId>webjars-locator-core</artifactId>
                                <version>0.27</version>
                    </dependency>

  
Here is the link to the webjars site for more information : [webjars site(http://www.webjars.org/)


[**Less CSS generator**]()
--------------------------

-   **Suffix**: .less

-    This one will handle LESS CSS resources to compile them to plain CSS
    resources.\
    This generator is based on Less4j :
    <https://github.com/SomMeri/less4j>.\
    Here is an example of mapping :

                jawr.css.bundle.styles.mappings=/css/foo.less,/css/bar.less     

 
-    To be able to use the less generator, you need to add less4j library
    in you classpath. For maven user, you'll need to add a dependency in
    your pom.xml :

 
                        <dependency>
                                <groupId>com.github.sommeri</groupId>
                        <artifactId>less4j</artifactId>
                        <version>1.14.0</version>
                        </dependency>

 
 -   Known limitation :

It's not possible to use less resource from classpath.
The below mapping will not work :

                jawr.css.bundle.styles.mappings=jar:/css/foo.less,jar:/css/bar.less     

-    Note :

For information, the less generator switched from an implementation
    based on [LessCss
    Engine](https://github.com/Asual/lesscss-engine) to
    one based on
    [Less4j](https://github.com/SomMeri/less4j) since the
    version 3.8, because the previous implementation is not
    supported anymore.


[**SASS Ruby generator**]()
---------------------------

-   **Suffix**: .scss

This one will handle SASS resources to compile them to plain CSS
    resources.\
    This generator is based on Ruby sass-gems. It is direct
    implementation of [sass-lang](http://sass-lang.com/)
    based on the [Ruby
    implementation](https://github.com/sass/sass).

Here is an example of mapping :


                jawr.css.bundle.styles.mappings=/css/foo.scss,/css/bar.scss     

To be able to use the SASS Ruby generator, you need to set the
    property \*jawr.css.sass.generator\* as follow :


                jawr.css.sass.generator=ruby    

    An you'll need also to add JRuby and sass-gems in your classpath.
    For maven users, you'll need to add the following dependencies in
    your pom.xml :

                                <dependency>
                                        <groupId>org.jruby</groupId>
                                        <artifactId>jruby-core</artifactId>
                                        <version>9.0.5.0</version>
                                </dependency>
                                <dependency>
                                        <groupId>org.jruby</groupId>
                                        <artifactId>jruby-stdlib</artifactId>
                                        <version>9.0.5.0</version>
                                </dependency>
                                <dependency>
                                        <groupId>com.darrinholst</groupId>
                                        <artifactId>sass-java-gems</artifactId>
                                        <version>3.4.4.3</version>
                                        <exclusions>
                                                <exclusion>
                                                        <groupId>org.jruby</groupId>
                                                        <artifactId>jruby-complete</artifactId>
                                                </exclusion>
                                        </exclusions>
                                </dependency>

    </div>

-   **Configuration properties**

Jawr provides the following properties to configure the Sass
    Ruby generator.

| **Property name** | **Type** | **Purpose** | **Default value** |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| jawr.css.sass.generator.urlMode | String |Defines the way the resource reference (image, font) will be handled. Possible values : "absolute" or "relative"  | absolute |

Known limitation :

   It's not possible to use sass resource from classpath.\
    The below mapping will not work :

                jawr.css.bundle.styles.mappings=jar:/css/foo.scss,jar:/css/bar.scss     


[**SASS Vaadin generator**]()
-----------------------------

-   **Suffix**: .scss

This one will handle SASS resources to compile them to plain CSS resources.  
Jawr provides 2 types of Sass generator. One based on [Vaadin sass compiler](https://github.com/vaadin/sass-compiler), the other based one the sass-gems ruby.

Here is an example of Sass resource mapping :

                jawr.css.bundle.styles.mappings=/css/foo.scss,/css/bar.scss     

To be able to use the SASS Vaadin generator, you need to set the property *jawr.css.sass.generator* as follow :

                jawr.css.sass.generator=vaadin  

And you need to add vaadin sass compiler library in you classpath.
For maven user, you'll need to add a dependency in your pom.xml :

                        <dependency>
                                <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
                        <artifactId>vaadin-sass-compiler</artifactId>
                        <version>0.9.12</version>
                </dependency>

-   **Configuration properties**

   Jawr provides the following properties to configure the Sass Vaadin generator.

| **Property name** | **Type** | **Purpose** | **Default value** |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| jawr.css.sass.generator.urlMode | String | Defines the way the resource reference (image, font) will be handled. Possible values : "absolute", "mixed" or "relative" | mixed |

Known limitation :

   It's not possible to use sass resource from classpath.  
   The below mapping will not work :

                jawr.css.bundle.styles.mappings=jar:/css/foo.scss,jar:/css/bar.scss     

[**CofeeScript generator**]()
-----------------------------

-   **Suffix**: .coffee

    This one will handle coffeeScript resources to compile them to plain
    JS resources

                jawr.js.bundle.myScript.mappings=/js/foo.coffee,/js/bar.coffee  

-   **Configuration properties**

   Jawr provides the following properties to configure the CoffeeScript generator.

| **Property name** | **Type** | **Purpose** | **Default value** |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| jawr.js.generator.coffee.script.options | String | The coffee script compiler options. Please see : http://coffeescript.org/) | None |
| jawr.js.generator.coffee.script.location | String | The coffee script location | net/jawr/web/resource/bundle/generator/js/coffee/coffee-script.js |
| jawr.js.generator.coffee.script.js.engine | String | The JS engine to use for the coffescript generator | the value of 'jawr.js.engine' property |


[**Skin generator**]()
----------------------

-   **Prefix**: skin

This one will help you to define CSS skin in your bundles. Full docs
[here](../tutorials/howToUseJawrCssSkin.html).


[**Skin switcher generator**]()
-------------------------------

-   **Prefix**: skinSwitcher

This one will generates the JS content for CSS skin switcher. Â  To use
it you must configure your Jawr configuration file like this :


    jawr.js.bundle.common.id=/js/common.js
    jawr.js.bundle.common.mappings=skinSwitcher:switcher.js


When you use the Jawr style tag for a bundle containing different CSS
skin, you can force Jawr to render the links to the alternate CSS skin
by using the **displayAlternate** property.


            <jwr:style src="/css/skinnedBundle.css" displayAlternate="true" media="all" />


This will force Jawr to render the links to all the skin associated to
**/css/skinnedBundle.css**. This generator will generates the script to
switch from a skin to another by calling the following JS function and
passing as parameter the name of the style to switch to:


            JAWR.skin.switchToStyle(newStyle);


You can find an example of it's use in the basic webapplication sample.
For more information about CSS skin, you can take a look to the
following [documentation](../tutorials/howToUseJawrCssSkin.html).

### [Implementing a generator]()

You will find below the class diagram for generators.

![Generator class diagram](../images/generator/jawr_generator.png)
The root interface for resource generator is :

-   net.jawr.web.resource.bundle.generator.ResourceGenerator. All
    resource generator must implement a method, which defines the
    mapping for this generator.

                /**
                 * Returns the resource generator resolver
                 * 
                 * @return the resource generator resolver
                 */
                public ResourceGeneratorResolver getResolver();


The getResolver() method returns the resolver, which will be used
    when mapping you generator to bundles. Jawr will recognize if a
    resource is handled by a Generator using the resolver, and use your
    generator when it applies. So, if your resolver is a PrefixResolver,
    which handle all resources beginning with 'foo:', you would map your
    generator like this:


                jawr.js.bundle.one.mappings=foo:somePath


There are 2 main types of generator:

-   net.jawr.web.resource.bundle.generator.TextResourceGenerator, which
    is the generator for the text resources (JS and CSS).
-   net.jawr.web.resource.bundle.generator.StreamResourceGenerator,
    which is the generator for the image resources.
-   Implementing a CSS or a JS generator

A JS or a CSS generator is an implementation of the
    interface net.jawr.web.resource.bundle.generator.TextResourceGenerator.
    This is a simple interface which exposes two methods:

    -   public Reader createResource(GeneratorContext context);
    -   public String getDebugModeRequestPath();

The getDebugModeRequestPath simply returns a path to be used in
    debug mode. This is simply a fake script or CSS name and it really
    has no importance unless you are mapping the Jawr servlet to a
    suffix different from \*.css or .js. 99% of the use cases don't need
    to care about this so you can simply return one of three constants:
    ResourceGenerator.JAVASCRIPT\_DEBUGPATH,
    ResourceGenerator.CSS\_DEBUGPATH or
    ResourceGenerator.IMG\_DEBUGPATH:


        public String getDebugModeRequestPath() {
                return ResourceGenerator.JAVASCRIPT_DEBUGPATH;
        }


Finally, the createResource() method is where the actual generation
    takes place. This method takes a single parameter of type
    GeneratorContext, which contains all the information you need to
    build a dynamic script or CSS. The useful methods are:

-   getPath(): this contains the mapping, without the prefix
        and parameters. For instance, in a mapping of the form
        'prefix:thePath(param)', this method returns 'thePath'.
-   getConfig(): returns the JawrConfig object used throughout
        the application. It contains data about the Jawr configuration,
        such as whether debug mode is on or off, the current servlet
        mapping, and so on.
-   getCharset(): returns the current charset, which the returned
        script or CSS must conform to.
-   getServletContext(): returns the application's ServletContext.
-   getParenthesesParam(): returns the params in parentheses, if any
        were declared. For instance, in a mapping such as
        'foo:path(aParam)', this would return 'aParam'.
-   getBracketsParam(): returns the params in brackets, if any
        were declared. For instance, in a mapping such as
        'foo:path(aParam)\[anotherParam\], this would
        return 'anotherParam'.

Using this information, you should be able to generate a script
        or CSS and return in in the form of a Reader object (typically a
        StringReader is sufficient for the task).

-   Implementing an Image resource generator

An image generator is an implementation of the
    interface net.jawr.web.resource.bundle.generator.StreamResourceGenerator.
    This is a simple interface which exposes one method:

-   public InputStream createResourceAsStream(GeneratorContext
        context);


### Mapping a generator

Once you have your Generator implemented, you need to register into Jawr
in order to use it. This is simply a matter of mapping its classname in
the configuration properties file under the key
'jawr.custom.generators'. If there is more than one, you simply declare
them separated by commas:


            jawr.custom.generators=com.mycompany.myapp.MyCustomGeneratorImplementation,com.mycompany.myapp.AnotherGenerator

### A simple example: an alert message generator

Here is a sample class which you can use to get started. It simply
creates a script that displays an alert message with whichever text is
used as the path in the mapping:


    package net.jawr.example;

            public class TestGenerator implements TextResourceGenerator {

            private ResourceGeneratorResolver resolver;
            
            public class TestGenerator(){
                    resolver = new PrefixedPathResolver("example");
            }
            
            public Reader createResource(GeneratorContext context) {
                    
                    return new StringReader(";alert('Mapping contained:" + context.getPath() +  "');");
            }

            public ResourceGeneratorResolver getResolver() {
                    return resolver;
            }
            
            public String getDebugModeRequestPath() {
                    return ResourceGenerator.JAVASCRIPT_DEBUGPATH;
            }
    }


With this class in hand, we first register it in our properties config
file:


            jawr.custom.generators=net.jawr.example.TestGenerator


And now it's a matter of creating a bundle and use the generator:


            jawr.js.bundle.global.id=/bundles/global.js
            jawr.js.bundle.global.mappings=example:Hello World!,example:And Hello Again!


And that's it, now add the bundle to any page and when it's loaded, you
should get an alert box with the text 'Mapping contained:Hello World!'
followed by a second alert box with the text 'Mapping contained:And
Hello Again!'.

### Security issues with generator

If you develop your own generator, which reads content from resources on
your server, you must take care of prevent users to access unauthorized
resources. You must check if the requested resource is an allowed one or
not. For example, the user must not be able to retrieve the files
located under /WEB-INF/ or /META-INF/ in your web application, or
directly the content of the JSP files.

To check if your generator is sensible to this issue, you must launch
your application in debug mode, and then try to reach your resource
using the following URL:

            http://localhost:8080/myWebAppContext/sample.js?generationConfigParam=myGen:/WEB-INF/web.xml

In this example, **myGen** is the prefix of the generator. So you must
replace it by the prefix of your generator. If you are able to see the
content of the web.xml file, this means that you need to change your
generator to fix this issue.
